## Player Core 

You play a character in a small Japanese town. The game is called Shogun World, but all player characters will be drawn from the Cronin (rich merchant class), Ronin(masterless warriors) and Kaichi (samuri of the lowest rank, where I will include koyakunin and ashigaru). At this time stratification was great, intermarriage between ranks of samurai was forbidden and the stipend for the lowest rank was a mere 15 koku of rice a year, or 13 koku and rations for two people or even less! This was at a time when one koku was a years worth of rice. A childless couple living along might be able to live on this, but with children and old people most of the low ranks have had to take on 'side-work', neglecting their training or studies to survive. Others marry into the Cronin families, bringing the prestige of the samurai class with them and leaving behind the poverty. This is a world where a lower rank samurai should remove his shoes and bow to a passing high rank, where any samurai may kill a commoner who does not show them sufficent respect, and where the scorn of workers is so ingrained a samuiria without a servent must wait for night to shop in the town to avoid being seen carrying everyday things.

You start with three stats: Rice, Ki and Honour

Rice represents your material wealth, the income you recieve from vassals and the power asscoaited with that.
Ki represents your inner energy, your will to live and connection to the natural world.
Honour represents your social standing, your ability to fufill your obligations and your connection to the martial world.
Stats can vary between maximums of +3 and -2. If it goes less then -2 your character is in mortal peril.

You also have a clan. Everybody has a clan. Depending on the realtionship between your clans, this can make things interesting.
When you want to do something, do it. If that happens to trigger a move, then do what the move tells you to do, then carry on. A 'Roll+x' means roll two six-sided dice and add that stat.


## Basic Moves

#### Suggest Obedience
When you subtly and politely remind a PC or an NPC that they need to do something, Roll+Ki
* On a 10+ they don't even realise, but will carry out that action at the first opportunity.
* On a 7-9 they do it but demand something in return.
* On a 6- they flat out refuse, take -1 to your Honour unless you escalate the situation.
When you use this move on a PC, they may choose between marking Xp to go along with it and taking a -1 to a single stat to make the situation go away.

#### Challenge Behaviour
When you directly and clearly state a PC or an NPCs actions are not honourable, Roll+Honour
* On a 10+ they are abashed, will stop the behaviour and must offer you something twice as valuable. You must accept it. 
* On a 7-9 they are shamed. Choose two: they stop the behaviour; they make amends; they will not seek revenge.
* On a 6- they escalate the situation unless you take -1 to your Ki and backdown.
When you use this move on a PC, they may choose between marking Xp to go along with it and taking a -1 to a single stat to make the situation go away.

### Demand Obligation
When you believe a PC or NPC owes you something due to an oath or their fealty, Roll+Rice
* On a 10+ they will provide the thing as soon as they are able.
* On a 7-9 they will offer you something close, similar or what they believe is a fair trade.
* On a 6- they give you it, despite what it costs them and the ripples it makes.
When you use this move on a PC, they may choose between marking Xp to go along with it and taking a -1 to a single stat to make the situation go away.

### Extend one's stipend
When you attempt to bribe or corrupt a PC or NPC, say what you'd like them to do and Roll + Rice
* On a 10+ they do it. 
* On a 7-9 they are willing, but it will cost enough you'll have to take -1 to your Rice.
* On a 6- they cling to their pride and refuse. They may consider you an enemy to the clan.

### Unbending Will
When the world presses down on you to give up on something and you summon up your inner strength, Roll+Ki
* On a 10+ You walk through the resistance as though it was not there
* On a 7-9 You press on but it will come back to haunt you, or will leave an alley in a tough place
* On a 6- Your nerve fails. Whatever the opposition was moves forward.

### Bared Steel
When the situation escalates and weapons are drawn, remeber your training and Roll+Honour
* On a 10+ Your skill is true. Choose three:
  ** They suffer deep wounds (-1 to Honour for them)
  ** You take control of something from them
  ** You impress, terrify or dismay them
  ** You yourself are unharmed
* On a 7-9 You are hard pressed. Choose one:
* On a 6- You slip. The opponent chooses one to act on you.
