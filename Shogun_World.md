# Shogun World

A game of intrigue, muddy peasants, and, to a lesser extent, samurai action.


## Agenda
* Don't waste your player's time
* Play to find out what happens
* Is unity more important than honour?


## Principles
### World
sprinkle evocative details everywhere 
make the world seem real
build a bigger world through play
look at npcs and your ideas through crosshairs
name everyone, make everyone human
always introduce someone by their clan before any other detail
### Player Characters
create interesting dilemmas not interesting plots
address yourself to the characters not players
ask provocative questions and build on the answers 
be a fan of the players characters 
sometimes, reflect a question back upon the players 
### Gm Moves
make your move but misdirect
make your move, but never speak its name
Think off screen too
always ask yourself if an npc action is honourable. Justify it



### Gm Moves:
give them a difficult decision to make
tell them the possible consequences and ask
Use a front or threat move
Offer an opportunity, with or without a cost
Turn a failed move back on them
Offer Stuff that's painfully expensive but good
Put the spotlight on someone
seperate them
Put them together 
make thier lives complicated now
use up their resources 
activate stuff's bad side
deal harm to players honour, justified or sneaky
create player-npc-clan triangle over a resource 

## Player Core 

You start with three stats: Rice, Ki and Honour

Rice represents your material wealth, the income you recieve from vassals and the power asscoaited with that.
Ki represents your inner energy, your will to live and connection to the natural world.
Honour represents your social standing, your ability to fufill your obligations and your connection to the martial world.
Stats can vary between maximums of +3 and -2. If it goes less then -2 your character is in mortal peril.

You also have a clan. Everybody has a clan. Depending on the realtionship between your clans, this can make things interesting.
When you want to do something, do it. If that happens to trigger a move, then do what the move tells you to do, then carry on. A 'Roll+x' means roll two six-sided dice and add that stat.


## Basic Moves

#### Suggest Obedience
When you subtly and politely remind a PC or an NPC that they need to do something, Roll+Ki
On a 10+ they don't even realise, but will carry out that action at the first opportunity
On a 7-9 they do it but demand something in return, do it cheaply/poorly or SOMETHING SOMETHING
On a 6- they flat out refuse, damaging your Hnour

This  move can force players with higher social rank to do things.
