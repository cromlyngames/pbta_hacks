This is a game for a group playing with a setting like Van Helsing, the Leauge of Extroadinary Gentlemen, Rest in Peace Department or Exorcists for the Machine.
By deafult, it's a fast paced, silly, action movie.

# Start
Skim read the moves. Go around the table. Apply a 2,1,0 and -1 to the following four stats: FIND, HUNT, KILL, MONSTER. 
Go around the table. For the 2 and the -1, briefly describe a nemesis (same or different) you fought and how you used that particular stat to defeat it. Write down the nemesis.
Go around the table. Make one Wyrd (see that section). How is it related to another player’s nemesis? What do the tags mean? (this ensures you are all at the same table)

# On the Job training
In play you will get one xp every time you fail a roll. Mark under that stat. When it hits five, increase that stat by 1 and erase the spent xp. No stat may be higher than +3
 You can also spend xp to get to get further Wyrd powers (see that section)

# Moves
In general, roll a 2d6+stat. 7+ succeeds. 10+ succeeds cleanly.
If 6- is not specified the GM makes a move.

## Investigate 
When you search a scene or archive for clues, ROLL+FIND
10+ ask three.
7-9 ask two
6- ask one and beware the background
-What might we be dealing with?
-What have they done in the past?
-What allies might they have?
-Anything weird this this time?
-Where might they be?


## Contact. 
Name someone who might be able to help. ROLL+FIND
10+ they have a good opinion of you
7-9 they’ll help, but you need to do something for them
6- when you get there someone different is waiting

## Watcher 
When you observe a target use their abilities ROLL+ FIND
10+ see their weakness
7-9 see three potential weaknesses

## Stalk 
When you risk danger to get closer as cat or mouse, ROLL + HUNT
10+ choose three
7-9 choose two
6- choose one
-They remain unaware of you
-You can bring others with you
-You keep your escape route open
-Take +1 forward to the next move

## Pride
When you work to help/block another player ROLL+HUNT
10+ give them +1 or -2 to their move
7-9 same, but you are thoroughly entangled in what they are doing

## Prepare 
Given sources (people, books, examples) and time to work you improve a mundane weapon/item. ROLL+HUNT
10+ choose two
7-9 choose one
-Add a positive tag to (can be chosen twice)
-It does not require a negative tag (otherwise it does)
-It does not harm you (otherwise it does)

## Blue Murder. 
When you can reach them and you mean it ROLL+KILL
10+ choose three
7-9 choose two
6- choose one
-You take them down
-They stay down
-You learn something new
-You don’t get hurt

## Bloody Mess. 
When you have inflicted harm ROLL+KILL
10+ NPCs do what you want. PCs do what you want or take more harm. Either way, they get 1xp.
7-9 NPCs do what you want but will want payment, revenge or will betray at some point (GM choice). PCs do what you want or take more harm. They get +1 forward to moves, even ones against you.

## Anatomy Lessons. 
When you patch someone up ROLL+KILL
On 10+ they heal two
On 7-9 they heal one

# MONSTER
When you use a Wyrd to make a move that you otherwise couldn’t you ROLL+MONSTER instead of the normal stat.

Example: using a Werewolf Curse (speed, violence, anger) to go *Blue Murder* on someone
Example: using The Poet’s Madness (visions, curses, addictive) to *Watcher* someone through the dreamworld.

When you fail a roll using Monster, mark xp on the Monster stat as usual.
The GM may also, when it seems fun, bribe you to act up your negative tag for 1 xp. This xp can be spent anywhere. 

## Make a starting Wyrd:
Choose two positive tags and one negative one. If it does damage choose a range tag for free. The tags form guidelines to help people agree when the wyrd applies. The negative tag is guidance for the GM if you fail a roll. It is typically something the monster part of you needs.
## Making a Wryd in play. 
When you fancy a change or the story demands it, Describe how your experiences have changed you. Roll+experience spent
On 14+ Choose two
7-9 choose one
-Add a positive tag to (can be chosen twice)
-It does not require a negative tag (otherwise it does)
-You get to choose all the tags (otherwise the GM chooses a player to choose one tag for you)

# Health
Everyone starts with 5 health. NPCs have 2 health.
Don't worry about tracking it too much, *Blue Murder* will dictate who goes down in accordance with action scene logic.
In terms of between-scene healing, a week or two in hospital will sort people out.

# Weapons
Everyone can start with a suitable weapon, if they need it.
A weapon can be bound with a wyrd, but it's still your wyrd.
Something that could kill a tied up person with a blow deals at least 2 damage. 
Something that'd cut the body into pieces deals 3 or 4 damaage.

# Wyrd Tags
Add your own to suit the game, as long as you have enthusiastic table agreement.
## Type 
Free tag to describe how it and you are joined. You can always have one of these for free.
-Blood
-Bound
-Contract
-Familiar  (loyal or not)
-Implanted
-Held
-Worn

## Positive Tags
