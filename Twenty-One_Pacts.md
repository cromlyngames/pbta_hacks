# 21 Pacts

A game of urban fantasy, set in the 70's, when the world could end and the RPG panic was real.
Can you keep a secret?

# Basic Engine
You will need playbooks, and a deck of cards for every three players (not couting the GM). Four players means two decks. Seven players means three.
Player's choose playbooks and assemble their characters.

GM shuffles cards togehter, and deals all players 13 cards to start their deck.
Players may not pickup, lookup or alter the order of their stack. The boardgaming terminology is a 'deck-builder'.
The stack represents the deep magical energies they have built up or accumulated. 
Remaining cards go in the center of the table in a neat pile, face down.

Players can draw the top four cards of their deck into their hand. These represent magical energies you have some control over.

For anyone to do a move, they describe what they are doing in the fiction that triggers the move. 
(Sometimes a GM may call for a move based on what they sa is happening in the fiction, INSERT EXAMPLE)
After the move triggers, the player turns over the top card from their deck and than can choose to turn over a second card, OR play a card from their hand
Like the card game 21, the results are added up, picture cards count as 10, aces count as 1.
As a general rule for moves:
  Beat 17 to succeed with a 'but'
  Hit 21 exactly to succeed with an 'and'
  Go over 21 to succeed but trigger a hard GM move too.

A move made with two balck cards is a constructive spell
A move made with two reds is a destructive spell
A move made with a mixture is a transformation spell

(so two balcks could create a statue out of thin air. Two reds could destroy a door. A mixture would be needed to turn someone into a frog)
Player ambition and cunning is valued here. You can justify using a Red card spell to destroy parts of a stone block to leave a statue  behind.
You could justify using a Black card spell to create a fireball that happens to burn the door. You could transform something into a bomb or an acorn)
