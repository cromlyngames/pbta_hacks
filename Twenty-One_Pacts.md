# 21 Pacts

A game of urban fantasy, set in the 70's, when the world could end and the RPG panic was real.
Can you keep a secret?

# Basic Engine
You will need playbooks, and a deck of cards for every three players (not couting the GM). Four players means two decks. Seven players means three.
Player's choose playbooks and assemble their characters.

GM shuffles cards togehter, and deals all players 13 cards to start their deck.
Players may not pickup, lookup or alter the order of their stack. The boardgaming terminology is a 'deck-builder'.
The stack represents the deep magical energies they have built up or accumulated. 
Remaining cards go in the center of the table in a neat pile, face down.

Players can draw the top four cards of their deck into their hand. These represent magical energies you have some control over.

For anyone to do a move, they describe what they are doing in the fiction that triggers the move. 
(Sometimes a GM may call for a move based on what they sa is happening in the fiction, INSERT EXAMPLE)
After the move triggers, the player turns over the top card from their deck and than can choose to turn over a second card, OR play a card from their hand
Like the card game 21, the results are added up, picture cards count as 10, aces count as 1.
As a general rule for moves:
  Beat 17 to succeed with a 'but'
  Hit 21 exactly to succeed with an 'and'
  Go over 21 to succeed but trigger a hard GM move too.

A move made with two balck cards is a constructive spell
A move made with two reds is a destructive spell
A move made with a mixture is a transformation spell

(so two balcks could create a statue out of thin air. Two reds could destroy a door. A mixture would be needed to turn someone into a frog)
Player ambition and cunning is valued here. You can justify using a Red card spell to destroy parts of a stone block to leave a statue  behind.
You could justify using a Black card spell to create a fireball that happens to burn the door. You could transform something into a bomb or an acorn)

# Building a city

Why Urban fantasy? Why the city?

Cities are close to us, they wrap around us, they feel familiar. In a horror game, familiar is the first step down into uncanny valley. You can talk of a city's loa, of it's spirit and people will understand the idea. They anthropomorphise the metro system, the highways, that weird building on the corner, that entire neighborhood of snooty new money. The idea of a city having a spirit, a gestalt, of all these fragements is intutive. 

Cities are also complex. There's a lot of systems interacting. If a bridge breaks in tolkienesque fantasy, it is time to quest to the lumberjack camp, but a major bridge coming down in a city... well, there's ripples. Riots are an urban thing, chaos held at bay by three meals and 24 hours. Chase that thread of an idea, and you are half way to a zombie story. Rampant inequality and competition and consumption is the other thread in that plait. If you need to feed, masses of people is a resource. Bureacracy and rules frame the game.

Pace of change is much higher in cities. New replaces old. New buildings. New tech. New tenants. Change can be on hourly basis. Consider the night time economy vs the early morning one. By same token, people wear different masks and layers for surroundings and times. The person fighting and spewing outside the club at 2am is the hollow eyed commuter at 8am is the blank professional by 3pm. This is why vampies and werewolves and the other descendents of gothic are such staples of urban fantasy. As ideas, they feed on places where there are hidden parts to the personality. 

Cities are where opportunities are. They are where the sink estates are. They are where immigrants flock for a chance and where stability, safety craving suburbanites escape from. The pace of change is a promise and a threat. Scale and variety and interlinking is and opportunity and a threat too. Your buisness coud be wildly succesfull. A single burst pipe could fill six hundred homes with sewage.
Cities have energy. They shine. And that is why magic users need to be there.
