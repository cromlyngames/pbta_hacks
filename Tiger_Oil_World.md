A pbta game set in 1980s hong kong kung fu action films.

The basic engine is you have things and moves. 
Things are things (sometimes called tags in other games). 
Moves are special rules that let you take control  of the fiction.
You say you do something (there is no try). If that is using a thing in a way described by the move, follow the rules for that move.
Generally, that means rolling a d20. 
-Rolling below ten is a failure
-Rolling seventeen or high is a screen stealing success
-Rolling between ten and sixteen is a success with a complication.
-If you roll with advantage, you can roll twice and keep the dice you want (normally highest one).
-If you roll with disadvantage, you roll twice and take the lowest.
-Each advantage and disadvantage pair cancel, so if you have two advantages and one disadvantage you roll with advantage.

# Basic moves: everyone gets these:
B1, when you *interrogate* someone: 
Roll. 
If you share a thing, roll with advantage. 
On 17+ ask four yes/no questions
On 10-16 ask two and answer one

B2, when you *aid* someone: say how you use your thing to help them and roll. 
On a 17+ they take advantage into their next roll.
On a 10-16 as above but your thing is risked on their roll.

B3, when you *take something by force*: Roll, if you use a thing roll with advantage.
On a 17+ trade harm as appropriate and get the thing you wanted.
On a 10-16 trade harm as appropriate and get something else useful.

B4, when you *move fast to dodge danger*: Roll. 
On a 17+ avoid harm and get where you are going.

# Things and thing-moves.
