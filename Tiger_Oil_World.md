A pbta game set in 1980s hong kong kung fu action films.

The basic engine is you have things and moves. 
Things are things (sometimes called tags in other games). 
Moves are special rules that let you take control  of the fiction.
You suseay you do something. If that is using a thing in a way described by the move, follow the rules for that move.
Generally, that means rolling a d20. 
Rolling below ten is a failure
Rolling seventeen or high is a screen stealing success
Rolling between ten and sixteen is a success with a complication.
If you roll with advantage, you can roll twice and keep the dice you want (normally highest one).

*Basic moves:* everyone gets these:
B1, when you interrogate someone: Roll. If you share a thing, roll with advantage. 
On 17+ ask four yes/no questions
On 10-16 ask two and answer one

B2, when you aid someone: say how you use your thing to help them and roll. 
On a 17+ they take advantage into their next roll.
On a 10-16 as above but your thing is risked on their roll.

B3, when you try to take something by force: Roll, if you use a thing roll with advantage.
On a 17+ trade harm as appropriate and get the thing you wanted.
On a 10-16 trade harm as appropriate and get something else useful.

B4, when you move fast to dodge danger: Roll. 
On a 17+ avoid harm and get where you are going.
On a 10-16 choose one and ask about the other.

*Things and thing-moves.* Start with three of these each.
Any thing can be used with any move, if it makes sense. 
Example Gang of Mooks or White Dojo could both do the Crowd Control move, if you have it.

*Harm and Experience*
You start with capacity to take five harm.
When you have two or lower harm left, roll at disadvantage.

When you use a thing mark if it was failure, complication or scene stealing success. 
Once a thing has all three it is *improved* and always rolls with advantage.
If an improved thing can be improved again you may take a new thing and move.
